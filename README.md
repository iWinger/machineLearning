# machineLearning
ML Algorithms implemented to predict house prices based on particular attributes.

Computation
------------
Linear Algebra techniques are highly involved in the process of determining the estimated price for the range.
Gauss-Jordan elimination, inverting, transposing, multiplication, adding matricies computed from a file with historical attributes data.

Programming Language
---------------------
Written in C. Used Makefiles to compile.
